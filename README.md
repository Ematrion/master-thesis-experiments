RSTT version of the experiments from chapter 4


Since the end of my master, I worked on realsing a stable version of the RSTT package. the tool I developed and used to perform simulation based research.
You can find documentation and tutorials on https://github.com/Ematrion/rstt. which is currently under review by the Python Open Science project.

As a consequence, the original experimental code is deprecated and the original rstt codebase no longer avilable upon request.

This repository offers all the experiments with up to date rstt syntax and with reproducible results. 

:warining: Work in progress.
Close to finish all re-implementation. Needs text and caption polishing.
